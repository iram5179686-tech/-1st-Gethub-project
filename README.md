Robotic and the future 1
This file was created as a school-level assignment on “Robotics and the Future” by researching basic concepts of robotics, organizing the information into clear sections, and writing it in simple and understandable language. The content was structured to cover the introduction, current uses, future scope, benefits, challenges, and conclusion, and then formatted using Overleaf (LaTeX) to produce a clean, professional-looking PDF suitable for academic submission.
